# Database Memory engine
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](LICENSE)

Database Memory MCP is a metadata-only RDB schema graph CLI and MCP server. It indexes relational database metadata into a local graph so people and agents can answer schema structure, dependency, diff, and impact questions without exposing table rows.

```text
Database catalog or DDL -> schema graph cache -> CLI / MCP typed queries
```

It is not a live SQL query tool, row-data assistant, deployment tool, or migration runner. Default adapters read catalogs, schema objects, PRAGMA metadata, or DDL-derived metadata; they do not read user table rows.

## Quick start

Build this engine from source with Rust, or use the binary prepared by the parent Visual Map build. Then index the included sample DDL and inspect its impact graph:

~~~powershell
database-memory index --source ddl-sqlite --path examples/sample-schema.sql --alias shop --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory impact-analysis ddl-sqlite:shop --object-key sqlite:shop:main:main:table:orders --max-depth 3 --limit 50 --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

For installation and MCP client configuration, see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Features

- Index only certified-complete database metadata into a local graph cache; failed analysis never replaces the last complete generation.
- List, find, and describe every canonical object kind, including views, routines, triggers, sequences, types, policies, packages, and extensions. Partition details remain metadata on their owning objects.
- Inspect the exact adapter/server identity, selected scope, discovered-versus-emitted counts, and capability evidence for each complete snapshot.
- Describe tables with columns, keys, inbound/outbound foreign keys, indexes, and capability warnings.
- Find tables and columns by name.
- Analyze impact from a table, column, or graph object key.
- Trace relationship paths through schema graph edges.
- Diff two indexed schema snapshots without treating connection-alias changes as schema changes.
- Use query_graph as a constrained, read-only graph query escape hatch after typed tools are not enough.

## Trust And Scale Behavior

- Snapshot replacement is transactional. A failed re-index keeps the last valid snapshot intact.
- New indexing has exactly two outcomes: `complete` with a verified proof, or `failed` with a structured, redacted error. There is no authoritative partial or unknown state.
- Old v1 caches remain readable but are explicitly reported as `legacy_non_authoritative`; re-index them before relying on completeness.
- Bare aliases work across database types when unique. Ambiguous aliases and duplicate table names return explicit errors with stable-key candidates.
- Generic object results include database, schema, kind, and stable object keys. Object pages clamp at 500; object relationship pages clamp at 200; graph traversals clamp depth to 8 and results to 200. Every bounded response reports clamping or truncation.
- MCP schema diffs default to 100 results and clamp at 200. Each change list, impact seed list, and the shared impact-node budget are bounded; exact category counts and `truncated` remain in the response.
- Bounded traversals merge inbound and outbound evidence before truncation and keep dependencies, constraints, and indexes ahead of broad ownership lists such as table columns.
- Ordinary stable keys keep the original colon-delimited form. Keys containing `:` or `%` inside an identifier use a backward-compatible `v2:` escaped form, so quoted database identifiers do not collide or misparse.
- Missing privileges, unsupported versions, opaque dependencies, catalog mutation, unresolved references, and adapter gaps fail closed instead of being represented as invented metadata.
- SQLite DDL is evaluated in an isolated in-memory database. Row statements, external attachment, virtual tables, and extension loading are denied. Input is deadline-bound and capped at 64 MiB total.

The Visual Map integration boundary is defined in [docs/contracts/visual-map-database-output-contract.md](docs/contracts/visual-map-database-output-contract.md).
Contributor test tiers and live certification commands are documented in
[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).
The repository-wide security assumptions and residual risks are documented in
[docs/security/threat-model.md](docs/security/threat-model.md); tracked upstream
maintenance exceptions are in
[docs/security/dependency-exceptions.md](docs/security/dependency-exceptions.md).

## Build and packaging

The parent `visual_map` repository owns the application bundle and release
packaging. This directory contains the engine source, tests, examples, and the
engine-specific installation/security/testing references linked below.

The CLI exposes the same versioned metadata-only contract as MCP. The generic v2 surface is `contract`, `index`, `list-snapshots`, `describe-snapshot`, `list-objects`, `find-objects`, and `describe-object`. The table-specific commands remain compatibility aliases.

~~~powershell
database-memory contract --format json
database-memory list-snapshots --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory list-objects ddl-sqlite:shop --kind table --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory find-objects ddl-sqlite:shop customer --kind column --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory describe-object ddl-sqlite:shop sqlite:shop:main:main:table:orders --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory inventory ddl-sqlite:shop --limit 100 --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory inventory ddl-sqlite:shop --offset 100 --limit 100 --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory impact-analysis ddl-sqlite:shop --object-key sqlite:shop:main:main:table:orders --max-depth 3 --limit 50 --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
database-memory trace-relationships ddl-sqlite:shop sqlite:shop:main:main:table:orders --max-depth 4 --limit 20 --format json --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

The contract reports `metadata_only: true`, `row_data_access: false`, exact certified versions/scopes, ODBC build availability, bounded limits, and the intentionally deferred DB2 boundary.
Inventory responses use stable table-key ordering and report `offset`, `has_more`, and `next_offset`, so callers can continue without treating the first page as the complete schema.

For live databases, keep credentials out of shell history and process arguments.
Define a profile with only its source in `.database-memory/config.toml`, then
provide `DATABASE_MEMORY_<ALIAS>_CONNECTION_STRING` at runtime. Non-alphanumeric
alias characters become `_` and the environment variable name is uppercase.

~~~toml
[warehouse]
source = "postgres"
~~~

~~~powershell
$env:DATABASE_MEMORY_WAREHOUSE_CONNECTION_STRING = "postgresql://user:password@host/database"
database-memory index --alias warehouse --cache-path .database-memory/warehouse.sqlite
~~~

The explicit `--connection-string` flag remains available for disposable local
development, but it can be exposed by shell history or process inspection.

## MCP Client Config

Use the built MCP stdio server binary. Full platform notes and alternate client shapes are in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

~~~json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database-memory": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/target/release/database-memory-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_MEMORY_MCP_ALLOWED_ROOTS": "/absolute/project:/absolute/cache"
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

On Windows, point command at `database-memory-mcp.exe` and separate multiple
allowed roots with `;`. Without this environment variable, the MCP server
allows local schema and cache paths only beneath its working directory.

## Try The Example Schema

The example schema is a small shop database in [examples/sample-schema.sql](examples/sample-schema.sql). It has customers, products, orders, order items, foreign keys, unique constraints, and indexes.

Index it directly from DDL:

~~~powershell
database-memory index --source ddl-sqlite --path examples/sample-schema.sql --alias shop --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

The complete index output includes the stable snapshot key, total object and relationship counts, adapter/server identity, selected scope, and the full completeness proof. A concise text run starts like this:

~~~text
snapshot indexed: ddl-sqlite:shop
status: complete
objects indexed: <verified total>
graph edges indexed: <verified projection total>
semantic relationships verified: <certified relationship total>
cache path: examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

DDL imports use the snapshot key ddl-sqlite:<alias>. The graph object keys still use sqlite:<alias>:... because the DDL source applies the SQL to an in-memory SQLite database and reuses SQLite metadata introspection. The DDL authorizer rejects external database attachment and extension loading.

Describe a table:

~~~powershell
database-memory describe-table ddl-sqlite:shop orders --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

Captured output:

~~~text
table: orders
columns:
  id INTEGER nullable: no
  customer_id INTEGER nullable: no
  status TEXT nullable: no
  created_at TEXT nullable: no
primary key: id
foreign keys:
  outbound:
    fk_orders_0: orders(customer_id) -> customers(id)
  inbound:
    fk_order_items_1: order_items(order_id) -> orders(id)
indexes:
  idx_orders_customer_id: customer_id unique: no primary: no
~~~

Find tables and columns:

~~~powershell
database-memory find-table ddl-sqlite:shop order --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

~~~text
order_items
orders
~~~

~~~powershell
database-memory find-column ddl-sqlite:shop customer --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

~~~text
orders.customer_id
~~~

Use `--format json` when the caller needs stable column/table keys, database and schema identity, type, nullability, default value, ordinal position, or generated-column state.

You can also materialize the schema yourself with SQLite, then index the resulting database file with --source sqlite.

~~~powershell
sqlite3 examples/shop.sqlite ".read examples/sample-schema.sql"
database-memory index --source sqlite --path examples/shop.sqlite --alias shop --cache-path examples/shop-cache.sqlite
~~~

## Example MCP Questions

After indexing the example schema, an agent can ask:

- What is impacted if orders.customer_id changes?
- Trace relationships outward from orders.customer_id.
- Find tables related to orders.
- Show me schema graph nodes whose names contain customer.

The MCP client may call impact_analysis like this:

~~~json
{
  "alias": "ddl-sqlite:shop",
  "table": "orders",
  "column": "customer_id",
  "direction": "outbound",
  "max_depth": 2,
  "cache_path": "examples/shop-cache.sqlite"
}
~~~

Representative decoded tool text (bounded-response metadata and edge endpoints are abbreviated below):

~~~json
{
  "direction": "outbound",
  "max_depth": 2,
  "object_key": "sqlite:shop:main:main:column:orders:customer_id",
  "snapshot_key": "ddl-sqlite:shop",
  "groups": [
    {
      "depth": 2,
      "label": "Column",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "depth": 2,
          "display_name": "id",
          "edge_type_used": "FK_TO_COLUMN",
          "label": "Column",
          "node_key": "sqlite:shop:main:main:column:customers:id"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "depth": 1,
      "label": "ForeignKey",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "depth": 1,
          "display_name": "fk_orders_0",
          "edge_type_used": "FK_FROM_COLUMN",
          "label": "ForeignKey",
          "node_key": "sqlite:shop:main:main:foreign_key:orders:fk_orders_0"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "depth": 1,
      "label": "Index",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "depth": 1,
          "display_name": "idx_orders_customer_id",
          "edge_type_used": "COLUMN_IN_INDEX",
          "label": "Index",
          "node_key": "sqlite:shop:main:main:index:orders:idx_orders_customer_id"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "capability_warnings": []
}
~~~

For relationship tracing from the same column, call trace_relationships with:

~~~json
{
  "alias": "ddl-sqlite:shop",
  "start_object_key": "sqlite:shop:main:main:column:orders:customer_id",
  "direction": "outbound",
  "max_depth": 2,
  "cache_path": "examples/shop-cache.sqlite"
}
~~~

The captured result includes paths from the column to idx_orders_customer_id, to fk_orders_0, and through that FK to customers.id.

## Certified Support Boundary

Every accepted source is metadata-only and must pass exact product/version detection, scope and privilege proof, stable catalog reads, canonical validation, and independent discovered-versus-emitted reconciliation. `database-memory contract --format json` is the machine-readable source of truth.

| Source | Certified versions | Scope and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sqlite` | Bundled runtime used by this binary | Read-only `main` catalog/schema. |
| `ddl-sqlite` | SQLite-compatible schema DDL | Isolated `main` catalog/schema; no row statements or external resources. |
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 | One connected database and selected schemas. Compatible products are rejected. |
| `yugabytedb` | YSQL `15.12-YB-2025.2.3.2-b0` | One connected database and selected schemas. Tablet, split, colocation, tablegroup, tablespace, and placement metadata are preserved. YCQL and other releases are rejected. |
| `mysql` | MySQL 8.0, 8.4, 9.7 | One selected database. MariaDB identity is rejected at this entrypoint. |
| `mariadb` | MariaDB 10.11, 11.4, 11.8, 12.3 | One selected database. MySQL identity is rejected at this entrypoint. |
| `sqlserver` | SQL Server 2017, 2019, 2022, 2025 Database Engine | One connected database and selected schemas. Azure variants are not claimed yet. |
| `oracle` | Oracle AI Database 26ai Free `23.26.2.0.0` | One connected PDB/non-CDB and selected owner schemas; Oracle Client 11.2+ is required. |
| `odbc` | Runtime-negotiated SQL Server bridge for the native-certified versions | Optional `odbc` build feature plus a matching 64-bit driver. Other products fail closed until a product strategy is live-certified. |
| `db2` | Not supported | Deliberately deferred because implementation/testing requires a separate IBM license/EULA decision the owner declined. |
